title: Creating interesting data visualizations
---

Hi! In this blog, we'll learn how to create a pretty data visualization of the Palmer Penguins data set.

## Importing the libraries and acquiring the data

In this activity, we'll be creating data visualizations using seaborn, but we'll also import matplotlib for some of its features.
```
#import the libraries  
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import urllib
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

url = "https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16A/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

Now, let's look at the data:

`penguins.head()`

## Creating a scatterplot

First, we create a scatterplot of the relationship between the penguins' body mass and their culmen length. 

The function to create a scatterplot using seaborn is `scatterplot`. To create plots in seaborn, we can specify a keyword `data` which is our dataframe, and some of the other parameters of the function would be assumed to be keys or vectors in data. 

```
sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x="Culmen Length (mm)", y="Body Mass (g)")
```

##Visualizing different subsets of the data

Now, what if we wanted the visualization to group the data points by the species of the penguin? Using seaborn, this can be done simply with the addition of just another parameter `hue`. 

```
sns.scatterplot(data = penguins, x="Culmen Length (mm)", 
                y="Body Mass (g)", hue="Species")
```

This presents the data points of different species in different colors, as shown below.

What's more, we can introduce another subset of the data using the parameter `size`, which presents different groups of data in different sizes. In this case, we will use the penguins' sex as another aspect to group by. 
```
sns.scatterplot(data = penguins, x="Culmen Length (mm)", y="Body Mass (g)", 
                hue="Species",size="Sex")
```

##Final details!

Our data visualization is mostly complete, but there are some minor details we could still improve. The legend, as of now, covers most of the plot and doesn't look very neat. I'd like to move the legend outside the plot. It seems that there's no way to do this with seaborn, so we'd have to use matplotlib for this. 

```
sns.scatterplot(data = penguins, x="Culmen Length (mm)", y="Body Mass (g)", hue="Species",size="Sex")
#moves the legend outside the plot
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.03, 0.8),loc="upper left")
```

The `bbox_to_anchor` value was mostly decided arbitrarily through trial and error.

We can also set a (kinda?) descriptive title using matplotlib's `title` function.

Finally, I think our plot could use better colors. You can check the different color palettes available here: https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html

The parameter to change the color palette in seaborn is `palette` and I like the flare one!

```
sns.scatterplot(data = penguins, x="Culmen Length (mm)", y="Body Mass (g)", hue="Species",size="Sex",palette="flare")
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.03, 0.8),loc="upper left")
plt.title("Body Mass vs. Culmen Length")
```

The plot is ready!!
